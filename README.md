# SillyTavern-Writing-Assistant
Makes life easier for people who suck at typing and are lazy like me. All it does is add buttons—like ** and ""—and a few more. When you click a button**,** it puts the formatting in your response bar. There is also a spell checker**,** Response generator**,** and Mood editor generator. Change settings in Quick Formatting & Spellchecker in the extensions page to use it.
AI features work with Open Router (OR) or Open AI (Oai). 
Everything**,** and mainly mobile**,** is a work in progress... why would you even download this?
